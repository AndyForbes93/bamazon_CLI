For Customers:  
As a customer you can select an item within the database and "purchase" any quantity you want, but if the amount you're asking for is too much Bamazon won't be able to fill your order.


For Managers:  
As a manager you have four commands. You can display the entire inventory, limit inventory by by what stock is currently low, add more products inventory to the database, and add new lines of products.

Thank you very much for checking out Bamazon Marketplace.
